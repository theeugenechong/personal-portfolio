In a thought-provoking podcast episode of the Lex Fridman podcast, Lex and John Vervaeke explore the nuanced interplay between intelligence, rationality, and wisdom. Their conversation highlights how these cognitive faculties interrelate and contribute to our ability to solve problems and make sound decisions.

Intelligence is fundamentally the tool we use to solve problems. It encompasses our capacity to utilise our mental faculties to think critically, analyse situations, and devise solutions. However, intelligence alone can be limited if we fall prey to self-deception. In other words, intelligence is not always a good thing.

This is where rationality comes in. Rationality is our mechanism for addressing the biases and distortions in our thinking that lead to self-deception, allowing us to refine our problem-solving processes. Essentially, rationality involves solving metaproblems — problems about how we approach problems.

Wisdom transcends both intelligence and rationality. It is the ability to coordinate various rationalities to discern the truth and make the right decisions. Wisdom involves solving metametaproblems — which means it deals with the highest level of problem-solving, integrating multiple layers of rationality to guide us toward sound judgements.

Reflecting further on these insights, I began to ponder the nature of self-deception. Self-deception can be understood as a subset of our rationalities persuading us to change our salient landscape — what we find important and what captures our attention. This can lead to actions that "seem right in our own eyes," justified by our own flawed rationale. This phenomenon explains why pathological rationalities can divert us from the path of wisdom.

But what causes pathological rationalities? While we recognize that intelligence gives rise to rationality, it is not always that straightforward. A contributing factor could be the misapplication of intelligence — solving the "wrong problems." Intelligence involves using our mental faculties to explore issues ingeniously, but if the usage of these resources are misguided, our rationalities can too become misguided.

This brings us to an essential aspect of life: truthfulness. Lying or not telling the truth distorts our reality, leading us to find value in the wrong places. Such distortions can foster pathological rationalities, veering us away from wisdom. Therefore, the pursuit of truth and the avoidance of self-deception are crucial. By maintaining a commitment to truth, we preserve the integrity of our rationalities, enabling us to achieve true wisdom.
