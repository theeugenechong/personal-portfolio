Scheduling is an essential tool for temporally organizing your day. As a student, having a rough plan of what you need to accomplish each day can be incredibly beneficial for efficient time management. Knowing what tasks lie ahead helps in allocating the right amount of time for each activity, reducing the stress of last-minute rushes and ensuring a balanced approach to work and leisure.

However, simply making a schedule can sometimes feel burdensome and might even lead to unnecessary suffering. The key is to shift your perspective on what a schedule represents. Instead of viewing it as a rigid structure that tyrannizes your day, consider it as a tool for designing the life you want. Imagine if you were taking care of yourself as you would a valued person â€” you'd want your days to be productive yet enjoyable.

To create a balanced schedule, you could start by identifying about five essential tasks that, if left undone, would negatively impact your life. By including these tasks in your schedule, you ensure that each day is slightly better than the last. This practice enforces the concept of continuous self-improvement, aiming to be a better person today than you were yesterday. Remember, habits only work in the long run, and a well-crafted schedule is vital for achieving this goal.

It is also crucial to incorporate rewards into your schedule. All work and no play can lead to burnout and resentment towards your schedule (or life in general). Think of how a good boss treats a valued employee: with fairness, respect, and recognition of their efforts. You should treat yourself the same way. Include in your schedule activities that you enjoy and look forward to, balancing work with leisure.

By treating yourself well, your schedule becomes not a source of stress, but a means of nurturing and growth. This approach helps maintain motivation and prevents rebellion against your own plans, much like how a slave would rebel against a tyrant. Instead, foster a healthy, supportive relationship with your daily routine, ensuring both productivity and happiness.
